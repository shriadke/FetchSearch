Act as an industry expert Data annotator working for an e-commerce platform that shows users available offers on their platform based on user search query. Your task is to generate user search query samples for the given offer text and output a dataset of sentence pairs in the format <search_query, offer, relevance_score>. The relevance_score is a score between 0 and 100 that you will have to assign to each pair based on the semantic similarity of the pair.

I will provide an example of task in hand and by learning from that, you will have to generate the further dataset. The input file will contain offer, brand and retailer. There will be a separate list of brands and categories as well. You have to understand relations between brands, categories, retailers, and the offers to generater the search_query terms.

Example:
input: 
{
"all_brands" : ["Back to the Roots", "Huggies", "Brita", "Sams clubs"],
"all_categories" : ["Food & Beverages", "Baby products", "Home decor"],
"offers" : [
{ 
"offer": "Back to the Roots, select varieties, at Walmart",
"brand": "Back to the Roots",
"retailer": "Walmart"
}
]
}

output: 
{
	"pairs" : [
				{"search_query" : "walmart",
				 "offer" : "Back to the Roots, select varieties, at Walmart",
				 "relevance_score" : 100},
				 {"search_query" : "Back to the roots",
				 "offer" : "Back to the Roots, select varieties, at Walmart",
				 "relevance_score" : 100},
				 {"search_query" : "variety",
				 "offer" : "Back to the Roots, select varieties, at Walmart",
				 "relevance_score" : 100},
				 {"search_query" : "gardening",
				 "offer" : "Back to the Roots, select varieties, at Walmart",
				 "relevance_score" : 75},
				 {"search_query" : "health",
				 "offer" : "Back to the Roots, select varieties, at Walmart",
				 "relevance_score" : 0},
			]
}

Now, learning from above example, please output the necessary dataset. The input is as below:

input: 
{
"all_brands" : ["MAD BEAN CO", "SOUTH SHORE BREWERY", "SIMILAC", "RED WOLF", "BOULEVARD", "SMIRNOFF ICE SMASH", "CHEETOS", "BAYERN SEASONAL", "DUST BOWL BREWING CO", "MIRABELLO", "SANTIAGO QUEIROLO", "MCKENZIE BREWING SEASONAL", "LAKE LOUIE BREWING", "CAMPO BRAVO", "CAULIPOWER LIVE LIFE ON THE VEG", "RED BRICK VARIETY PACK", "LEOPOLD BROS", "405 BREWING CO", "POLAR FROST", "CHATEAU LANDAT", "SANTA SILVANA IN VILLA", "REPUBLIC SPIRIT BLENDS", "DALMORE", "WOODSTOCK INN VARIETY PACK", "FRIEND AND FARMER", "MAD BEAN VANILLA ICED COFFEE", "BRYANTS", "JOLIE FOLLE", "MORTLACH", "UPSLOPE SPIKED SNOWMELT CRAFT HARD SELTZER V", "MINGLEWOOD", "BEACH DAY EVERY DAY", "THREE WEAV3RS", "PRO FORCE MEMBERS MARK", "JACK DANIELS", "WACONIA BREWING COMPANY", "JUMEX", "CIELO", "CRAZY ELK", "MIO", "GREAT LAKES COMMODORE PERRY", "MINUTE RICE", "BACIO DELLA LUNA", "DEZZANI", "DUCK FOOT", "LIVE FOR TOMORROW", "CORDERO CON PIEL LOBO", "KING ESTATE", "ARIZONA", "FAT HEADS BREWERY", "RUM CHATA", "MINNESOTA NICE", "CONNIES", "LIL SELTZ", "Snack Factory", "NO LI BREWHOUSE", "STONE BROOK WINERY", "PBC", "GREATER GOOD", "SARDON", "TAFTS BREWING CO", "SOUTHERN TIER HI CURRENT CRAFT HARD SELTZER", "HAP AND HARRYS", "PEPPERIDGE FARM", "LEAN CUISINE", "CONAIR", "MATTHEW FOX VINEYARDS", "SCREAMIN SICILIAN", "FRAMINGHAM", "PFRIEM", "WILDCRAFT CIDER WORKS", "THREE FINGERS HIGH", "AX", "BRONX BREWERY", "WRINKLED", "REBEL YELL", "DIAL", "BOSS DOG", "MEZCAL BUENBICHO", "PINALEN", "CRACKER JACK", "OCEAN", "RUSH RIVER", "VEUVE DU VERNAY", "NEYAH", "MIDNIGHT BREWERY", "OREO OS", "MODELO CHELADA", "CHATEAU PALENE", "ECO BY NATY", "FEVER-TREE", "SILVER GHOST", "GATE CITY BREWING CO", "CHUPAHOPRA", "FOOTHILLS BREWING", "FIELD DAY", "MICHELOB DRY", "TRUTH BE TOLD", "LOREAL PARIS COSMETICS", "HOPPIN FROG", "YEE HAW BREWING CO", "NUE"]
